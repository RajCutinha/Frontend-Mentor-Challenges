### The challenge

Build out the **Website/Application** close
to how the design looks from the provided Design Files

 <br/>
 
#### Users should be able to:
- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the pages

### My process

- Looking into the desgin Files provided by Frontend Mentor
- Thinking about the build process and breaking it down into smaller steps
- Thinking about how to structure the Project (What do i need ?)
- After the 3 previous steps i start my building
- If i get stuck i first go to the docs to find the answer myself
- If i dont find it myself i look on others solution and try to undertand how they have done it
- Still if i cant find the answer i continue searching up on YouTube. I never search for a full project. By breaking down the Project beforehand i just search for the component i have to build (like a image slider). I build it out and then i try to implement it into the projects.
